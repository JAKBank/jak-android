# JAK App

JAK App is an open source app for JAK Members Bank in Sweden (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jakapp).

### Setting up JAK App in Eclipse
(Currently we use Eclipse, but we're happy to accept contributions to make it IDE agnostic)
1. Download and install [ADT Bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html) or install [Eclipse/ADT](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) separately
2. Clone this project to some place (not in your Eclipse-workspace folder)
3. In Eclipse choose File-menu > Import > Android > Existing Android Code Into Workspace
4. Browse to the source code folder
5. Check the box and click Finish
6. Setup android-support-v7-appcompat as a library project in your workspace

We just started this project so you will likely run into some issues.
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this code please
contact Adam Nyb√§ck (adam.nyback on Skype or email adam@anyro.se) or
post in the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jakapp).
Thanks.
