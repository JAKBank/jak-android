# JAK App

JAK App is an open source app for JAK Members Bank in Sweden (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jakapp).

### Setting up JAK App in Eclipse
(Currently we use Eclipse, but we're happy to accept contributions to make it IDE agnostic)

1. Download and install [ADT Bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html) or install [Eclipse/ADT](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) separately
2. Clone this project to some place, not in your Eclipse-workspace folder. You can also fork the project if you prefer to contribute using pull requests.
3. In Eclipse choose File-menu > Import > Android > Existing Android Code Into Workspace
4. Browse to the source code folder
5. Check the box and click Finish
6. Setup [android-support-v7-appcompat as a library project](https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html#libs-with-res) in your workspace
7. Go to the Android preferences of your project and change the path of the support library if it doesn't match already

We use [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and currently there is only one branch called "develop".

We just started this project so you will likely run into some issues.
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this code please
contact Adam Nyb√§ck (adam.nyback on Skype or email adam@anyro.se) or
post in the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jakapp).
Thanks.
